# Task_1

Thanks my code work I could solve different problems as I expect - more, faster, easier. In some situations nobody helps me or someone needs solutions, than I decide to do myself code work. I'm happy when I see other people using my programs, which helps them in the normal work. Now, for me, code work is also professional matter. Only professional thinking and working could help solving more problems and faster.
